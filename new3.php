	OnePlus announced the company's first 5G smartphone – the OnePlus 7 Pro 5G – just over a month ago in the UK. The company has now pushed out an update for the OnePlus 7 Pro 5G, which brings a host of bug fixes related to the software and the camera. The update also introduces optimisations for the DC dimming feature, double-tap-to-wake gesture, and the ambient display. The new OxygenOS build is currently being rolled out in a staged manner and is expected to reach all OnePlus 7 Pro 5G users soon.

The OxygenOS 9.5.4 update for the OnePlus 7 Pro 5G resolves an issue with the lock screen, which caused the fingerprint animation to persist on the screen even after the authentication process has finished. It also fixes an issue that prevented app icons from displaying once the phone had been unlocked. Another issue which caused the selfie camera to pop up during an incoming voice call has been ironed out as well.
